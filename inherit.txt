Inheritance allows uus to reuse and extend existing code, Instead of rewriting the same logic in multiple classs, we can put shared methods
and attributes in a base class, and have other classes inherit from it. This helps make our programs most organized and reduce code duplication
for the same task. Inheritance also supports polymorphism, which means we cna uses a base class reference to work with objects of its subclasses.
This makes it eassier to write flexible and extensible programs. For example, we can have a base class called Sahpe with a draw() method, and 
sublass like Circle and Square can each have their own version of draw() while still being used in the same way.
